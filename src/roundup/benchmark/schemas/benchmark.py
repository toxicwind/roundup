"""
Benchmark data models and metrics for generative AI performance measurement.

Provides comprehensive data structures for capturing, storing, and analyzing
benchmark results from scheduler-driven generative AI workload executions.
Core abstractions include base benchmark interfaces, generative-specific
metrics with token/latency distributions, request-level statistics tracking,
and multi-benchmark reporting capabilities. These models enable detailed
performance analysis including throughput, latency, concurrency patterns, and
domain-specific metrics for text, image, video, and audio generation tasks.
