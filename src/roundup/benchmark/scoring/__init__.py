"""Pluggable response-quality scoring for benchmarks.

Built-in scorers:
    instruction_following  exact/contains grading borrowed from the estate
                           abstract probe (probe_abstract.py): 2.0 exact,
                           1.0 contains-with-extra, 0.0 miss.

Adapters:
    ThinkingBlockStripper  removes <think>/<thinking>/<reasoning>/
                           <thought>/<scratchpad> spans and fenced thinking
                           blocks before delegating
                           to an inner scorer. Enabled per scorer with
                           ``strip_thinking: true`` in ``scorer_config``.
